Motorola 68000 emulation engine, kinda

This was created to emulate the M68K processor. But also, you know, to have a fun challenge ;)

## History

This was originally created back in 2018, when I was still a high-school student. However, in order to modernize and improve the codebase, the Botsashi engine is currently being rewritten at the moment. If you wish to look at the code from before the rewrite, check out the current master branch.

## Example

This repo comes with a simple example project designed to test the engine.

# Plans

## Near-term

Complete Motorola 68000 support (as of right now, this engine supports only a tiny subset of the M68K instruction set without any interrupt support)
